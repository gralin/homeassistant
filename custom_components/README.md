# Custom Components for Home Assistant 

This is a repository for my custom components for Home Assistant.

## Custom Components
- mcp23017 binary_sensor:
  mcp23017 is and I/O expander that I am using to connect my doors and windows sensors (reed sensors) to a Raspberry Pi running Home Assistant.
- mcp23017 switch:

## Getting Started

To use these customs components you need to create a custom_components directory inside you Home Assistant configuration directory. In a Raspbian installation it will be ~/.homeassistant.
You will be placing the components inside this directory.

### Prerequisites

The mcp23017 communicates with the Raspberry Pi through I2C serial communication. I2C on Raspbian is disabled by default so you will have to enable it.
This is a good guide with screenshots on how to enable I2C on Raspbian: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c

You will also have to add the Home Assistant user to the i2c group:

```
sudo usermod -a -G i2c homeassistant
```
### Requirements

Requirements in Home Assistant are installed on the fly but it's good for you to know that mcp23017 component uses and therefore requires the following python modules:
- RPi.GPIO
- adafruit-blinka
- adafruit-circuitpython-mcp230xx

### Installing mcp23017 binary_sensor

Place the contents of mcp23017 directory inside ~/.homeassistant/custom_components/mcp23017
The easiest way is using svn, if you don't have it installed you can install it with:

```shell
sudo apt install subversion
```
Now, you can do the following:

```shell
$ ssh your_user@raspberrypi
$ sudo -u homeassistant -H -s
$ cd ~/.homeassistant
$ mkdir custom_components/
$ cd custom_components/
$ svn checkout https://github.com/jardiamj/homeassistant/trunk/custom_components/mcp23017
```
I have implemented the hardware pin interrupts configured as mirrors. That means
that you only need to connect one of the interrupt pins (port A or B) to a
Raspberry Pi pin and it will trigger an interrupt whenever a binary sensor state
changes.
The interrupt_port option is the Raspberry Pi's actual GPIO number (not the pin
number) to which the MCP23017 interrup pint is connected to.
To use the mcp23017 binary sensor in your installation, add the following to your configuration.yaml file:

```yaml
# New Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: mcp23017
    pull_mode: UP
    invert_logic: true
    interrupt_port: 12
    chips:
      - i2c_address: 0x20
        pins:
          8: pin8
          9: pin9
          10: pin10
          11: pin11
          12: pin12
          13: pin13
          14: pin14
          15: pin15
      - i2c_address: 0x24
        pins:
          8: prototypepcbpin8
```
To use the mcp23017 switch components in your installation, add the following to your configuration.yaml file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  - platform: mcp23017
    i2c_address: 0x20
    pins:
      11: Fan Office 
      12: Light Desk 
```

invert_logic:
  description: If `true`, inverts the output logic to ACTIVE LOW.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: "`false` (ACTIVE HIGH)"
pull_mode:
  description: >
    Type of internal pull resistor to use.
    Options are `UP` - pull-up resistor and `DOWN` - pull-down resistor.
  required: false

  default: "`UP`"
{% endconfiguration %}

NOTE: MCP23017 only has internal pull-up resistors, if you want to use pull-down you will have to wire your own pull-down resistors.
